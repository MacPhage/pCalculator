About "PotentCalculator"

The Potent Calculator is a C++ console application made by 14 year-old Austin Jackson,

of Houston, Texas, in the United States of America.



It allows calculation of basic operations (+,-,*,/) via the Command Prompt (Windows) or 

Terminal (Mac OS X). It also features automatic calculating of such functions like

exponents and square root to Geometrical distance and midpoint, and many more.



You can find the latest version of it on my website here:
